            <Comment>Version bump to 2.4 beta1:
                The critical features that needs a lot of testing till the stable version is:
                * Transcoding: Now you can convert tracks from one file format to another when copying from the file browser to the local collection.
                * Shiny new collection scanner, rewritten from scratch - it should now detect compilations in a more robust way
                * Writing back to tags: there is now an option to have Amarok write statistics and album covers to the files directly, so you can save your play counts and tags in the files themselves.
                -- Added new features:
                * The ability to show and hide the menu bar
                * Mass-tagging UI using Musicbrainz
                * The ability to use iPod Touch 3G and possibly newer devices

                * A map and calendar view for the upcoming events applet
                * A new Playdar collection that lets you listen to music provided by a local Playdar service.
                -- A lot of bugs have been fixed and improvements made especially on the Context View applets and the playlist. For details please see the changelog file.
