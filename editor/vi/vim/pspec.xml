                *Update to patchlevel 100,
                *Fixed this problems;
                 -Explanation about making a diff for extra_patches is unclear.
                 -rename(from, to) deletes the file if "from" and "to" are not equal but still refer to the same file.
                 -rename(from, to) doesn't work if "from" and "to" differ only in case on a system that ignores case in file names.
                 -When deleting a fold that is specified with markers the cursor position may be wrong.  Folds may not be displayed properly after a delete.  Wrong fold may be deleted.
                 -"killed" netbeans events are not handled correctly.
                 -When typing a composing character just after starting completion may access memory before its allocation point.
                 -Compiler warning for floating point overflow on VAX.
                 -When 'ff' is "mac" then "ga" on a ^J shows 0x0d instead of 0x0a.
                 -":tag" does not return to the right tag entry from the tag stack.
                 -Recursive structures are not handled properly in Python vim.eval().
                 -Using ":diffget 1" in buffer 1 corrupts the text.
                 -Adding URL to 'path' doesn't work to edit a file.
                 -User command containing 0x80 in multi-byte character does not work properly.
                 -":cs help" output is not aligned for some languages.
                 -Some error messages are not translated.
                 -Compiler warning for signed/unsigned compare.
                 -With Visual selection, "r" and then CTRL-C Visual mode is stopped but the highlighting is not removed.
                 -After ":number" the "Press Enter" message may be on the wrong screen, if switching screens for shell commands.
                 -"!xterm" doesn't work when 'shell' is "bash".
                 -Warning for signed/unsigned pointer.
                 -Changing GUI options causes an unnecessary redraw when the GUI isn't active.
                 -When using ":source" on a FIFO or something else that can't rewind the first three bytes are skipped.

                *Update to patchlevel 60,
                *Fixed this problems:
                 -In diff mode, when using two tabs, each with two diffed buffers, editing a buffer of the other tab messes up the diff.
                 -When using winrestview() in a BufWinEnter autocommand the window is scrolled anyway.
                 -VMS: Too many characters are escaped in filename and shell commands.
                 -Crash because of STRCPY() being over protective of the destination size.
                 -The Python interface has an empty entry in sys.path.
                 -Wrong check for filling buffer with encoding.
                 -Starting Vim with the -nb argument while it's not supported causes the other side to hang.
                 -v:prevcount is changed too often.  Counts are not multiplied when setting v:count.
                 -Warnings for not checking return value of fwrite().
                 -Can't avoid 'wildignore' and 'suffixes' for glob() and globpath().
                 -synIDattr() doesn't support "sp" for special color.
                 -Crash when using WorkShop command ":ws foo".
                 -Compilation warnings for format in getchar.c.
                 -Various compiler warnings with strict checking.
                 -Combination of int and size_t may not work.
                 -Can't add a patch name to the ":version" output.
                 -Diff display is not always updated.
